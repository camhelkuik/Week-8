## Chapter 20, Exercise 20.7 from book Visual C# How to Program

Write a generic method, Search, that searches an array using the linear-search algorithm. Method Search should compare the search key with each element in its array parameter until the search key is found or until the end of the array is reached. If the search key is found, return its location in the array; otherwise, return -1. Write a test app that inputs and searches an int array and a double array. Provide buttons that the user can click to randomly generate int and double values. Display the generated values in a TextBox, so the user knows what values they can search for (Hint: Use (T:IComparable<T>) in the where clause for method Search so that you can use method ComparesTo to compare the search key to the elements in the array).
